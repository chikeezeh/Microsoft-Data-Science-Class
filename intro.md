## Basic Skills for a data scientist.

1. Everyday Statistics
2. Maths
3. Soft Skills (Communication)
4. Programming Languages (e.g R or Python)
5. Modelling


### Data Types

1. Categorical data: Text like data for example days of the week in a sales record data.
2. Temporal data: These represent dates and times, there's a specific order associated with them.
3. Numerical Data: Divided into continous data types (e.g Temperature measurement) or Discrete (counted data, e.g sales number)

### Normal Distribution

The data is distributed in such a way that it looks like a bell curve.
The mode, median, and mode are in the center of the curve.
~ 68.26% of all observations lie between 1 standard devation above or below the mean.
~ 95.45% of all observations lie between 2 standard devation above or below the mean.
~ 99.73% of all observations lie between 3 standard devation above or below the mean.
